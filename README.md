# Advanced Data Structures

### These are the most of the algorithms that I learned in the first semester of the master's degree and were applied by Java language in the following algorithms. Also some summaries of these algorithms were added in the documents file: 


1- AVL Tree

2- Binary Heap

3- Binary Search Tree (BST)

4- Dynamic Programming

5- Greedy algorithm

6- Hashmap algorithm

7- levenshtein distance algorithm

8- Priority Queues algorithm

9- Redâ€“black Tree algorithm

10- shortest path graph algorithm (SPT)
