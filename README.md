# Advanced Data Structures

### These are most of the algorithms I learned in the first semester of the Master's degree and were applied in Java like:

1- AVL Tree
2- Binary Heap
3- Binary Search Tree (BST)
4- Dynamic Programming
5- Greedy algorithm
6- Hashmap algorithms
7- levenshtein distance algorithm
8- Priority Queues algorithm
9- Redâ€“black Tree algorithms
10- shortest path graph algorithm (SPT)
