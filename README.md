# Advanced Data Structures

### These are most of the algorithms I learned in the first semester of Master's degree and have been applied by Java language in the following algorithms: 


1- AVL Tree

2- Binary Heap

3- Binary Search Tree (BST)

4- Dynamic Programming

5- Greedy algorithm

6- Hashmap algorithm

7- levenshtein distance algorithm

8- Priority Queues algorithm

9- Redâ€“black Tree algorithm

10- shortest path graph algorithm (SPT)
